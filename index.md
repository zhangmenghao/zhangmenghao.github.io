## About Me

* **Biography**:
    - *Jul., 2021-Now*  **Joint Post-Doctoral Researcher**, Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University & Networking Team, Kuaishou Technology
    - *Sep., 2016-Jun., 2021*  **Ph.D. Degree**, Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. From my undergraduate years to Feb., 2019, I spent about 3.5 years working under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/), a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019. Then I switched to the supervision of [Dr. Jianping Wu](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4003.htm) and [Dr. Mingwei Xu](http://routing.netlab.edu.cn/tiki-index.php?page=Mingwei+Xu), to continue my Ph.D. study. During the past few years, I am fortunate to work with partners from my lab (Dr. Zhaogeng Li, Dr. Kai Gao, Jiasong Bai, [Guanyu Li](https://guanyu.li/), Yi Qiao, Shicheng Wang, Chang Liu, Xiao Kong, Cheng Guo, Han Bao and etc.) and collaborators from Rice University ([Dr. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/)), Texas A&M University ([Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/), [Dr. Lei Xu](http://students.cse.tamu.edu/xray2012/)) and University at Buffalo, SUNY. ([Dr. Hongxin Hu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hongxinh/)). 
    From Feb., 2019 to Jul., 2019, I worked as a visiting scholar at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, under the supervision of [Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/).
    - *Aug., 2012-Jul., 2016*  **B.S. Degree**, Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University
* **Research interest**: 
    - Software-Defined Programmable Network Security. I am one of the first researchers to work on the intersections of programmable networks and security, and have published across a wide range of well-recognized conferences and journals in this area such as NDSS, NSDI, INFOCOM, ICNP, RAID, HotNets, SOSR, JSAC, TON, TDSC, TPDS and etc. I am familiar with Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Programmable data plane (P4), and extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF). Besides, I have deeply involved in a set of scenarios, such as data center network, cloud gateway, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS), Internet of Things (IoT), network scanning, network traffic analysis, container network and etc. Most of my projects are trying to make software-defined networked systems more security and efficient. 
    - High-Performance Networking. Recently I am working on the area of high-performance networking (e.g., RDMA, SmartNIC, DPU/IPU, DPDK) in large-scale real-world data center scenarios, especially large-scale distributed machine learning clusters.
