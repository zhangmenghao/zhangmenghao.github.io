## Biography

* *Aug., 2012-Jul., 2016*  **B.S. Degree**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University
* *Sep., 2016-Present*  **Ph.D. student**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University. From my undergraduate years to Feb., 2019, I spent about 3.5 years working under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/), a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019. Then I switched to the supervision of [Dr. Jianping Wu](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224194435414856631/20101224194435414856631_.html), [Dr. Mingwei Xu](http://routing.netlab.edu.cn/tiki-index.php?page=Mingwei+Xu) and [Dr. Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/), to continue my Ph.D. study. During the past few years, I am fortunate to work with partners from my lab (Dr. Zhaogeng Li, Dr. Kai Gao, Jiasong Bai, Guanyu Li, Yi Qiao, Shicheng Wang, Chang Liu, Xiao Kong and etc.) and collaborators from Rice University ([Dr. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/)), Texas A&M University ([Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/), [Dr. Lei Xu](http://students.cse.tamu.edu/xray2012/)) and Clemson University ([Dr. Hongxin Hu](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~hongxih/)). 
* *Feb., 2019-Jul., 2019*  **visiting scholar**, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, under the supervision of [Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/).
* **Research interest**: I am familiar with Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Programmable data plane (P4). Besides, I have deeply involved in a set of scenarios, such as cloud gateway, Denial-of-Service attacks, Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System, Internet of Things and etc. Most of my projects are trying to make distributed system more security and reliable.
