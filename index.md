## Biography

* Aug., 2012-Jul., 2016  **B.S. Degree**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University
* Sep., 2016-Present    **Ph.D. student**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/). I am fortunate to work with partners from my lab (Zhaogeng Li, Kai Gao, Jiasong Bai, Guanyu Li, Yi Qiao and etc.) and collaborators from Rice University ([Prof. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/)), Texas A&M University ([Prof. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/), [Lei Xu](http://students.cse.tamu.edu/xray2012/)) and Clemson University ([Prof. Hongxin Hu](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~hongxih/)). 
From Feb., 2019 to Jul., 2019, I spent 5 months working as a visiting scholar in the Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, under the supervision of [Prof. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/).
* **Research interest**: Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Programmable data plane. Most of my projects are trying to make distributed system more security and reliable.
