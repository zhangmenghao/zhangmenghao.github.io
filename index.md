## Biography
* *Aug., 2012-Jul., 2016*  **B.S. Degree**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University
* *Sep., 2016-Present*  **Ph.D. student**, Dept. of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University. From my undergraduate years to Feb., 2019, I spent about 3.5 years working under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/), a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019. Then I switched to the supervision of [Dr. Jianping Wu](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224194435414856631/20101224194435414856631_.html) and [Dr. Mingwei Xu](http://routing.netlab.edu.cn/tiki-index.php?page=Mingwei+Xu), to continue my Ph.D. study. During the past few years, I am fortunate to work with partners from my lab (Dr. Zhaogeng Li, Dr. Kai Gao, Jiasong Bai, [Guanyu Li](https://guanyu.li/), Yi Qiao, Shicheng Wang, Chang Liu, Xiao Kong and etc.) and collaborators from Rice University ([Dr. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/)), Texas A&M University ([Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/), [Dr. Lei Xu](http://students.cse.tamu.edu/xray2012/)) and University at Buffalo, SUNY. ([Dr. Hongxin Hu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hongxinh/)). 
* *Feb., 2019-Jul., 2019*  **visiting scholar**, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, under the supervision of [Dr. Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/).
* **Research interest**: (1) Software-Defined Programmable Network Security. I am familiar with Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Programmable data plane (P4), and extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF). Besides, I have deeply involved in a set of scenarios, such as data center network, cloud gateway, Denial-of-Service attacks, Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System, Internet of Things, Network Scanning, containers and etc. Most of my projects are trying to make software-defined networked systems more security and efficient. (2) Data-driven Network Anomaly Detection and Mitigation. I am also interested in leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to do data-driven anomaly detection (e.g., network traffic analysis), which I believe is a promising direction.
